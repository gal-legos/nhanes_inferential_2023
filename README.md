# NHANES Inferential Analysis Project 
For this assignment we were tasked with utilizing NHANES datasets to answer a series of questions. The analysis was to be concocted using python and R script for each one. Using data previews to find the needed columns required to answer the questions and data cleaning queries, inferential statistic tests were run. Below are the summaries and findings of the questions provided, as well as a link to the Google Colab notebook that holds all of the data. In addition to running and creating the codes we were tasked with coming up with the last question (question 5) ourselves using at least one variable and can be answered with either an ANOVA-test, t-test, Chi squared test, or correlation.

### Question 1 
For Question 1, we analyzed NHANES data on marital status and educational attainment to determine whether there is a relationship between these two variables. The Chi-square test produced a Chi squared  value of 0 and a p-value of 1. A Chi squared value of 0 indicates that the observed frequencies in the data perfectly match the expected frequencies, meaning there is no difference from what would be expected by chance. Based on these results, we can conclude that marital status and education level are not associated in this dataset; in other words, an individual’s marital status does not appear to be related to their level of education.

### Question 2 
In Question 2, marital status and sedentary behavior data were analyzed to assess whether there was a significant difference in mean sedentary time between married and non-married individuals. An independent samples t-test was conducted to compare the means of the two groups. The results yielded a t-statistic of -4.37 and a p-value of 0.0000. Given that the p-value is less than 0.001, the difference between the groups is considered statistically significant. The negative t-value indicates that the mean sedentary time for one group is significantly lower than that of the other, suggesting that marital status is associated with differences in sedentary behavior.

### Question 3 
In this analysis, we examined the relationship between age, marital status, and systolic blood pressure using data from the DEMO and BPXO datasets. A linear regression model was applied, with systolic blood pressure serving as the dependent variable and age and marital status as the independent variables. The model produced an R squared value of 0.134, indicating that approximately 13% of the variation in systolic blood pressure can be explained by these two predictors. The F-statistic (452.9, p < 0.001) confirms that the overall model is statistically significant. Among the predictors, age demonstrated a stronger association with systolic blood pressure, showing that blood pressure tends to increase with age. Marital status also had a statistically significant but smaller effect, with married individuals exhibiting slightly lower blood pressure compared to unmarried individuals. Although the model is statistically significant, it explains only a modest portion of the variation, suggesting that additional factors, such as lifestyle, diet, and genetics may also influence blood pressure.

### Question 4 
For Question 4, the relationship between self-reported weight and sedentary behavior was examined using variables from the WHQ and PAQ datasets. A correlation analysis was conducted to determine whether a linear association exists between these two variables. The results indicated a correlation coefficient of r = 0.156 and a p-value = 1.000. The low r-value suggests a very weak positive relationship, while the high p-value indicates that this finding is not statistically significant. Therefore, based on these results, there is no evidence of a meaningful correlation between self-reported weight and sedentary behavior in this dataset.

### Question 5 
For question 5, an independent samples t-test was conducted to examine the mean difference in systolic blood pressure between individuals with and without Hepatitis B antibodies. The analysis yielded a t-statistic of -6.0175, indicating that one group exhibited a lower mean systolic blood pressure compared to the other. The p-value of <0.001 demonstrates a statistically significant difference between the two groups, suggesting that Hepatitis B antibody status is associated with variations in systolic blood pressure. However, the underlying factors contributing to this association would require further investigation and more detailed data to determine potential causal mechanisms.
