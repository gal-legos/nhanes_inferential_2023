# NHANES Inferential Analysis Project 
For this assignment we were tasked with utilizing NHANES datasets to answer a series of questions. The analysis was to be concocted using python and R script for each one. Using data previews to find the needed columns required to answer the questions and data cleaning queries, inferential statistic tests were run. Below are the summaries and findings of the questions provided, as well as a link to the Google Colab notebook that holds all of the data. In addition to running and creating the codes we were tasked with coming up with the last question (question 5) ourselves using at least one variable and can be answered with either an ANOVA-test, t-test, Chi squared test, or correlation.

### Question 1 
A chi-square test of independence is used for this question because both variables, marital status and education level, are categorical. The goal of the analysis is to determine whether there is an association between these two categories, specifically whether being married or not married is related to having a bachelor’s degree or higher. The chi-square test compares the observed frequencies of participants in each category combination (for example, married individuals with a bachelor’s degree) to the expected frequencies that would occur if marital status and education level were independent. If the difference between observed and expected frequencies is large enough (as indicated by a low p-value, typically less than 0.05), we can conclude that there is a statistically significant association between the two variables. In this context, the chi-square test is appropriate because it evaluates relationships between two nominal variables rather than comparing means or measuring numerical relationships.

### Question 2 
A t-test is used for this question because it compares the means of a continuous variable between two independent groups. In this case, the continuous variable is sedentary behavior time (PAD680), and the grouping variable is marital status (married vs. not married). The goal is to determine whether the average sedentary time differs significantly between those two groups. An independent sample t-test evaluates whether the difference in means observed in the sample is large enough to suggest a true difference in the population, rather than random variation. The test assumes that sedentary time is approximately normally distributed within each group and that the two groups are independent. If the p-value from the t-test is below a chosen significance level (typically 0.05), it indicates that married and not married individuals differ significantly in their mean sedentary behavior time. This makes the t-test appropriate because it’s specifically designed to compare one continuous outcome variable between two categorical groups.

### Question 3 
A multiple linear regression is used for this question because it allows us to examine how two or more independent variables, age and marital status, simultaneously affect a continuous dependent variable, which is systolic blood pressure (BPXOSY3). Unlike a simple regression, which tests the relationship between one predictor and one outcome, multiple linear regression evaluates the unique contribution of each predictor while controlling for the others. This means we can see whether marital status is associated with systolic blood pressure after accounting for age, and vice versa. The test assumes that the dependent variable (systolic blood pressure) is continuous and approximately normally distributed, and that the relationship between predictors and the outcome is linear. By using multiple linear regression, we can determine both the direction (positive or negative) and strength of the relationships, as well as whether each predictor has a statistically significant effect on blood pressure. This makes it the most appropriate method for understanding how age and marital status together influence systolic blood pressure.

### Question 4 
A correlation is used for this question because it aims to examine the relationship between two continuous variables: self-reported weight (WHD020) and sedentary behavior (PAD680). Both variables are numeric and measured on a continuous scale, making them suitable for correlation analysis. The Pearson correlation specifically assesses the strength and direction of a linear relationship between the two variables. The resulting correlation coefficient indicates whether higher weight is associated with more or less sedentary behavior, while the p-value tests whether this observed relationship is statistically significant. Unlike tests that compare groups, such as t-tests, or predictive models like regression, correlation focuses solely on whether the two variables move together and the nature of that association.

### Question 5 
A t-test is used for this question because it examines whether there is a difference in the mean of a continuous variable, systolic blood pressure, between two independent groups: individuals who test positive versus those who test negative for hepatitis B antibodies. The t-test determines whether the observed difference in mean blood pressure between the two groups is statistically significant, accounting for variability within each group. This test is appropriate because the outcome variable is numeric and continuous, while the grouping variable is categorical with exactly two levels, allowing for a direct comparison of group means.
